- This is a small demo game scene inspired by two famous games "Limbo" and "Inside" of Playdead Studio ( www.playdead.com ) , which I finished them both, such masterpiece series. They truly motivate me to learn how to make awesome games :D
- Also my first game lesson when self-learning Unity 2D

- Game type: Puzzle-platformer adventure game

- "Arrow Keys" to move the Player
- "Esc" to pause game
- "Space" to jump
- Objective: Survive through the scary forest by solving the puzzles. Those puzzles can be solved with interactions from Player to Environment or Surrounding Objects in appropriate order

- Enjoy!
